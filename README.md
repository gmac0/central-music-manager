## What is this thing and why would anyone use it?

This project was born out of a specific problem. There's music on all the devices in my house, in various states of (dis)organization. I have a stereo system set up that I like to listen to music on, but invariably it involved plugging in some laptop or phone and then hoping the tracks I was looking to listen to were actually on that device. I often found myself streaming music off the internet mostly because I didn't want to go through the hassle of locating and hooking up whatever device to play my own tunes. So, I wanted to create a solution. All my music organized in one place. All my music accessible and controllable from any place.

## Specific capabilities

So I set off. Here's what I am hoping the project will do:

* House my entire music collection in a way that is intelligently organized and easily searchable.
* Be accessible from anywhere. Both anywhere in the house and anywhere with internet connectivity so I can play songs from my library even if they aren't currently downloaded on my phone.
* Have playback controls accessible from any internet-enabled device within the home WiFi network. I want to be able to choose a song from my library and play in my living room without getting out of bed.
* Actually sound awesome. Play FLAC files and other losses formats. Also, be able to handle a wide variety of less awesome file types. Both WMA and AAC files hopefully.
* Be lightweight enough to run on a Raspberry Pi or other microcomputer.
